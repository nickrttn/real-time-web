# A real-time web application built on Node.js

A real-time web application built on Node.js. The application is a simple chat application used to explore [socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io). Communication runs over websockets.

## How to run it

Execute the following commands in a terminal window:

1. `git clone https://github.com/nickrttn/real-time-web.git`
2. `cd real-time-web && touch .env`
3. Open `.env` and define the port you want to listen on: `PORT=3000`. `3000` is just a suggestion.
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run build`
5. `npm run start`

The application is now running on [localhost:PORT](http://localhost:3000).
